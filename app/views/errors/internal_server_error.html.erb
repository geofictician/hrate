<h1>Application error</h1>
<%# altered 20210906 by luciano %>
<p>The OpenGeofiction server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request (HTTP 500)</p>
<p>Feel free to <a href="http://wiki.opengeofiction.net/index.php/OpenGeofiction:Contact" title="Contact channels">contact</a> the OpenGeofictician community if your problem persists. Make a note of the exact URL / post data of your request.</p>
<p>This may be a problem in our Ruby On Rails code. 500 occurs with exceptions thrown outside of an action (like in Dispatcher setups or broken Ruby code)</p>
